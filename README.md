Relevant Market
Some people don't like eating lunch by themselves, but love going out to eat. This app allows them to find a partner in crime for an hour, no strings attached, and just enjoy meeting someone new.

Summary of Current State
A social networking app which matches authenticated users in the area, with the intention of bringing strangers together to share a meal. Users can: signup, login, set restaurant preferences, and receive the contact information of the app-generated match. Backend logic processes user inputed data, uses said data to query the database (current version hooked to an MLab database), and sends requested information back to the client. External API calls were made to ipstack in order to fetch user location.

Projections for Future Development
Our origninal plans had included authenticated sign in, a chat channel between matched users which would expire after approximately 4-5 hours, and geospatial calculations which would allow for matching users by closest proximity (as of now users in the same city are matched).
